# DA_Stock_Market_14_to_16
Data Stock Market from 2014 through 2016

By using Excel VBA scripting, I analyzed the stock market data to help break down variables into small pieces, allowing the reader to access clean data. Additionally, I added variables to help understand which stock markets are successful or unsuccessful. I also created shades of coloring, maximum, minimum, and other codes to clean up the data.

## Background

Here is a picture of the outcome when the stock market is analyzed. As you can see, in the first column are the tickers. The tickers represent the stock market symbol. However, there are multiple instances of the same ticker. The next column over is the date. Following the date column is the opening price of the stock. Three columns away from the opening price is the closing price, which is the price at the end of that year. One of the columns will show the yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year. This column also has colors where red represents negative and green represents positive. The upper right corner of the analyzed data displays the highest volume, increase, and lowest decrease percentage of the following year.

The stock market in 2014 was the worst time to invest due to the lowest percentage increase and the lowest total volume. What caused the year 2014 to perform worse than 2016 and 2015? No specific data was given, but according to research, it was oil. An article states that oil prices reduced by up to 40 percent, which took a huge toll on the stock market. Mutual funds also performed terribly in 2014, dropping by at least 40 percent. There are other factors, but mutual funds and oil were the biggest influencers in the stock market.

### Stock Market Analyzed 2015 Outcome

The stock market in 2015 was the best time to invest with the highest percentage increase. The ticker with the greatest percentage increase was SR, which symbolizes Spire Inc., a company known for gas utilities on the East Coast. Detailed reasons for SR's success are not provided, but one possibility could be the number of people moving to the East Coast.
